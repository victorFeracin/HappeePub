# Happee Pub


## About:

A simple fictious responsive website designed and coded by myself using pure HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I started if off with Adobe Xd to design the wireframe and prototype the interface. After this step, I started to write the code, first with the HTML5 structure, then I added the CSS styles using mostly Flexbox properties. I used JS plugins as well to put the finishing touches in the website, such as the Google Maps API display, the Hamburger menu animation, the Slider menu and the Fade-down effects in the pages.
I registered the domain in a free hosting service (000Webhost), to show my work to interested people.
